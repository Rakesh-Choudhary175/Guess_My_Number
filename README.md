"Guess My Number" is a simple number guessing game implemented as a project. The project follows the following steps:

Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 20. This number will be the target number that the user needs to guess.

User Input: The user is prompted to input a number of their choice, attempting to guess the randomly generated number.

Number Comparison: The program checks if the user's guessed number is the same as the randomly generated target number.

Game Outcome: If the user's guessed number matches the target number, the program declares the user as the winner and displays their score. The score is the number of attempts it took for the user to guess the correct number, with the maximum possible score being 20 (if the user gets it on their first attempt) and the minimum score being 1 (if the user guesses correctly on their 20th attempt).

Highest Score: The program keeps track of the highest score achieved so far in the game and displays it to the user.

Reset Game: An "Again" button is provided to reset the game, allowing the user to play again from scratch.

Overall, "Guess My Number" is an entertaining and interactive project that challenges users to make accurate guesses while keeping track of their performance by maintaining the highest score achieved in previous attempts.
